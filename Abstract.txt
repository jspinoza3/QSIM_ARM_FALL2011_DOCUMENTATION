Abstract
Memory hierarchy is an important factor in systems design. In order to fully
optimize the addition of hardware and improvement in performance. To study 
the performance of a program on cpu, we need to simulate the execution of the
program and measure the timing of the program. There are emulators that can 
take the program and run it on the cpu, but, it will run on the host machine.
There is no way to define the memory hierarchy and simulate the structure of
CPU and measure the time. We do have simulators that allow us to define the 
model, take the program as input and calculate the execution time of the 
program. For such simulators, you need assembly instruction and the simulator
doesn't execute the code, it just simulates the access and write times.
Hence, it is a code inspection software. We need to run the program and get
all the instructions executed. once, we have the instructions, we can use
the timing simulator to find out the metrics of performance of the cpu.
The purpose of our software is to extract the list of executed instructions
from the emulator for input into timing simulators. Our focus is to develop
such a tool for an ARM emulator.
